    <p><font color="Brown" face="Times_New_Roman" size="7"> This is a paragraph of brown font. 
        Brown, like the wood the homesteaders use to ply their trade. 
       <b> Brown, like the beavers coat, when the sun is at dusk wane.
    </b>
        <i>Brown, like the mired hands of so many sullen woes.</i>
        <u>Brown, like the brown of a well traveled road.</u>
