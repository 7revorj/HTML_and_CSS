### Portfolio

>This is an unfinished version of my portfolio. It includes a background video animated with keyframes moveVideoText, navbar animated with keyframes moveNav effect, viewport adjustments & @media rule for visibility on various sized browsers, text animated to fall from top of screen with CSS, hover effects over text and images, various containers, rounded images, intermediate formatting, hover effects for input boxes and submit button, an AI generated video, links to my GitHub, a functional and formatted contact form using formspree.io.

>For the up-to-date version of my portfolio please see my JavaScript repository or visit 7revorj.github.io

### Academy Cinemas Sample Site

>This is a sample homepage for a fictitious cinema in Portland, Oregon and styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many bootstrap components including images nested in a card deck, colored pill badges, anchor links, navbar, dropdowns, form, and jumbotron.
### AI Anime Self-Portrait
>This page displays an AI-generated self-portrait in the style of an anime vigilante and includes nested containers which layer text over a filtered image over a video which becomes visible upon mouse-over.
### AI Dreams by WOMBO
>This is the only project that has two iterations in different stages of completion, Dreams Artwork Project, and AIDreams Alternate. This is because one of them is more appropriate for the presentation of the art, but the one which is less visually pleasing will be enhanced later with JavaScript and the finished version will be displayed in that repository.
### Armored Core VI Fan Site
>This page is a very basic fan site for the recently released Armored Core VI. It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, embedded YouTube videos using YouTube's API
### Creating a CSS Menu
>This page is an example of animations in CSS using multiple images and hover effects to create a drop-down menu and CSS animation properties. Also contains a navbar, and menu containers using unordered lists.
### Black Mirror Fan Site
>I started this project the day Black Mirror Season 6 released, so that became the subject.
This very basic website includes a nav bar, a video player, use of nth-child, hidden text revealed upon click using span and div elements, and a form.
### Miscellaneous
>There are various other folders in this repository that are not worth mentioning except to say that they were used for educational purposes and to meet the qualifications for various assignments while studying at The Tech Academy.
